# Project discontinued

## ðŸš€ A chatbot that solves the technical problems that people have in the #questions channel of MindsDB.

# How it works

The MindsDB chatbot uses a combination of a database, a large language model (LLM), and an interface to generate responses to questions.

The database stores the MindsDB technical WIKI and all the solutions that have been given to problems of the past. The LLM processes the information in the database to understand the questions that are being asked and to generate relevant responses. The interface generates the responses in a format that is easy to read and understand.
